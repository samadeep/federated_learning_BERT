**Project Overview**

* **Title:** Email Spam Classification using BERT with Federated Learning (Flower)
* **Description:** This project demonstrates how to leverage the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained deep learning model, for email spam classification using Flower, a federated learning framework.

**Key Concepts**

* **BERT:** A pre-trained transformer model adept at natural language understanding tasks.
* **Federated Learning:** A collaborative machine learning approach where training data remains distributed across devices or servers, enhancing privacy and security.
* **Flower:** A framework that simplifies federated learning workflows.

**Data Preparation**

1. **Data Source:** Describe the email spam classification dataset (e.g., publicly available, custom collection).
2. **Preprocessing:** Explain how you prepare the data for BERT:
   - Text cleaning (removing noise, punctuation)
   - Tokenization (breaking text into smaller units)
   - Padding/truncating sequences to a uniform length
   - Converting tokens to numerical representations (using BERT's vocabulary)

**Model Definition**

1. **Model Selection:** Specify the chosen pre-trained BERT model variant (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Explain how you adapt the pre-trained model for email spam classification:
   - Adding a custom final layer (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification)
   - Freezing or fine-tuning specific BERT layers based on complexity and dataset size

**Federated Learning with Flower**

1. **Client Simulation:** Describe how you simulate multiple clients within a single machine using Flower:
   - Distribution of training data to simulated clients (e.g., random or stratified sampling)
   - Communication between clients and the central server (Flower) for model updates

**Federated Learning Workflow (Dot Diagram)**

```dot

digraph G {
    
    // Nodes
    A [label="Clients (Simulated)"];
    B [label="Local Models"];
    C [label="Global Model"];
    A1 [label="Weighted Averaging"];
    A2 [label="Median Aggregation"];
    A3 [label="Robust Aggregation"];
    A4 [label="Differential Privacy"];
    A5 [label="Secure Aggregation"];
    A6 [label="Homomorphic Encryption"];
    A7 [label="Efficient Communication"];
    A8 [label="Asynchronous Updates"];

    // Edges
    A -> B [label="Train on Local Data"];
    B -> C [label="Aggregate Updates"];
    C -> A [label="Update Clients"];

    // Subgraphs
    subgraph cluster_0 {
        label = "Custom Aggregation Strategy";
        A1; A2; A3;
    }

    subgraph cluster_1 {
        label = "Data Privacy and Security";
        A4; A5; A6;
    }

    subgraph cluster_2 {
        label = "Communication and Efficiency";
        A7; A8;
    }

}
```

### Running the Project

**Prerequisites** : List required libraries (e.g., transformers, flower) and installation instructions.
**Customization** : Explain how to modify the main.py file to adjust training parameters:
- Number of clients
- Training epochs per round
- Number of federated learning rounds
- Client script filename
- Dataset size per client
- Execution: Provide clear instructions on running the project with the modified main.py file:
- Command to execute
  ```shell
    python3 main.py
  ```
